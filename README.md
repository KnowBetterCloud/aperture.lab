Black Mesa is a repo for creating a Kubernetes environment on my laptop.

Status: WIP

Ultimately this Repo will be used to create a Kubernetes enviornment on my laptop running Fedora.

The laptop:  A Dell XPS 9520 (12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-12900HK, 32GB Memory, 1TB SSD) - while this machine is a powerhouse, I would not recommend it as I am having issues that are not show-stoppers, but certainly are aggravating.  (Desktop hangs occasionally, services "go out to lunch" and drive up my CPU, battery life is abysmal - 3 to 4 hours on battery, tops)
